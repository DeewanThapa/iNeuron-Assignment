This is achieved through a set of rules that allow tensors to be used together in element-wise operations.\n",

Instead, the operation is carried out using a virtual view of the tensor that appears to have the larger shape.

This means that it does not increase memory usage significantly, as it only changes the way the tensor is viewed and how operations are applied.\n",

        "Rule: If an index appears exactly twice in a single term of the notation (once on the left-hand side and once on the right-hand side), it implies summation over that index. This rule is used to avoid writing explicit summation signs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: It streamlines notation and makes it more concise, reducing the need for cumbersome summation symbols and improving readability.\n",

        "\n",

        "This indicates that we sum over the index j.\n",
        "2. Free and Dummy Indices\n",
        "Rule: Indices that appear only once on the left-hand side of the equation are called free indices. They represent dimensions in the resulting tensor. Indices that appear twice are dummy indices and are summed over.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: This distinction helps in clearly identifying which indices are involved in the summation and which ones define the shape of the resulting tensor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In the notation 'ik,kj->ij':\n",
        "\n",
        "i and j are free indices and appear only once on the left-hand side.\n",
        "k is a dummy index and appears twice (once in ik and once in kj), so we sum over k.\n",
        "3. Index Consistency\n",
        "Rule: The indices on the left-hand side of the equation must match those on the right-hand side in terms of their number and placement. The left-hand side represents the tensors to be multiplied or combined, while the right-hand side represents the resulting tensor shape.\n",

        "Definition: The forward pass refers to the process of passing input data through the neural network to obtain an output or prediction. During this phase, the input is propagated through each layer of the network, applying the weights, biases, and activation functions to produce the final output.\n",

        "Output: This process continues through all the layers of the network until the final output layer produces the network’s prediction.\n",
